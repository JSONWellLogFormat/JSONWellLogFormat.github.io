Amendment by Petroware AS:
--------------------------

The JSON Well Log Format files are converted from the original Volve dataset
available here: http://data.equinor.com.

The original well log data are in DLIS, LIS, LAS, ASC and SPWLA format.
The conversion has been done using the bulk data conversion module of
Log Studio from Petroware.

A few of the original data files are corrupt or invalid and have been ignored.

As of February 2019 the JSON conversion has not been manually or othervise
verified. This will be done during Q2/2019 and any errors and omissions will
be corrected and uploaded.

Please report any issues to info@jsonwelllogformat.org.

The data shall not be resold.
